### PROJECT UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Check the [schematic](https://github.com/gpcm00/power-meter/blob/main/Documentation/Schematic.pdf) in the documetation folder to check how power is measured and logged.

The PCB was developed in KiCAD. You can get them in the PCB-Files folder,

I am currently developing the firmware. Find the current status of the firmware [here](https://github.com/users/gpcm00/projects/2)

I will add a proper documentation for the power meter once the firmware is done, but right now I want to focus on finishing the software.
