### PROJECT UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Check the schematic in the documetation folder to check how power is measured and logged.

The PCB was developed in KiCAD. You can get them in the PCB-Files folder,

I am currently developing the firmware. Find the current status of the firmware [here](https://github.com/users/gpcm00/projects/2)

I will add a proper documentation for the power meter once the firmware is done, but right now I want to focus on finishing the software.
